# atomGit user.js for Firefox and its derivatives

this is a security and privacy centric user.js file for Firefox and its derivatives

the bulk of this code was forked from the excellent user.js config provided by @ghacksuserjs (https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js) to which my personal settings are (mostly) appended

i intend to keep up to date with @ghacksuserjs code, leaving it as untouched as possible while appending my own code to his user.js

=== WARNING: ===

you should probably read the relevent section(s) of the 'Firefox Configuration Guide for Privacy Freaks and Performance Buffs' (http://12bytes.org/articles/tech/firefoxgecko-configuration-guide-for-privacy-and-performance-buffs) before incorporating this user.js file which depends heavily upon the properly configured uBlock Origin (https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and uMatrix (https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix) browser extensions or, at the very least, back-up your entire Firefox profile before importing this user.js
